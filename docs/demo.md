You can currently sign up to use a shared, on-line demo of searchrefiner. This demo will be slower than using an instance installed locally or at an institution level, because there may be many other concurrent users. Please register for an account at the following address:

<div class="flex three one-600 ">
    <div>
        <article class="card">
            <footer class>
                <a href="https://ielab-sysrev2.uqcloud.net">Click here to go to searchrefiner</a>
            </footer>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

Approval must be given to access the on-line demo. If approval is taking longer than expected, please email [h.scells@uq.net.au](mailto:h.scells@uq.net.au). The core components if searchrefiner (including the query visualisation) are open source. If you would like to install searchrefiner locally or for your institution, please read the [documentation](/searchrefiner/documentation).
